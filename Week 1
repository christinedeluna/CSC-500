#Part 1

# Use proxy numbers 50 and 23

# Define the first number
number1 = 50

# Define the second number
number2 = 23

# Calculate the sum of the numbers
sum_result = number1 + number2
print("The sum of the numbers is:", sum_result)

# Calculate the difference of the numbers
difference_result = number1 - number2

#Part 2

# Use proxy numbers 150 and 200

# Define the first number
number1 = 150

# Define the second number
number2 = 200

# Calculate the product of the numbers
product = number1 * number2
